### Blog API

 Express and MongoDB RESTful API. The back-end component of a blog project, which also includes a blog built in React and an Admin CMS.


## Notes
- User auth handled via JWT.
- JWT expiration is currently handled on the client-side. "login" endpoint issues tokens. Needs attention. 
- App authorisation needs to be implemented.
